	The ChipUSM association was founded in 2022 by a self-organized group of students with an interest in microelectronics. 
	This initiative was born to <b>gather and represent</b> the students of UTFSM who work in Integrated Circuit design,
	to enhance collaborations and <b>recognition of student participation in the Chilean microelectronics ecosystem</b>.
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Mission:</b> To provide UTFSM students with the necessary conditions to develop in the field of microelectronics. 
	<br><br>

	<b>Vision:</b> To be a pioneering association in microelectronics, driving our university to position itself as a leader in this discipline,
	training engineers who will develop the integrated circuits industry in Chile and Latin America. 
	<br><br>

	<b>Objectives:</b>
	<ul style="text-align: justify">
		<li> Promote the participation of UTFSM students in integrated circuit (IC) design and related projects; </li>
		<li> Encourage knowledge transfer and collaboration among various teams working in the field of ICs within the University, as well as with external entities; and </li>
		<li> Manage access to technical and technological resources to enable student work in IC subjects. </li>
	</ul>
